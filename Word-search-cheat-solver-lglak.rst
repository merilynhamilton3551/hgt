This scrabble word finder takes the same dictionary and anagram engine behind the word solver and adapts it into a scrabble cheat tool. The results are ranked by points, so the highest scoring words are shown first. The same engine also works as text twist solver or words with friends cheat (with different scrabble word points values). About Our Wordus Cheat Tool. Wordus is a new word game on iOS and Android heavily inspired by the popular new game Wordle. Try and find the final word within a limited number of guesses. Playing the game is identical to Wordle. You will be presented with empty spots and a keyboard of letters. Simply type in a word and search. WordFinder™ isn’t just a word search. It’s a total WWF cheat solution. All you need to do is type in your letter tiles and hit the search button. The Words With Friends® cheat tool provides a full list of playable, legal words from those letters, straight from the Words With Friends® game.
