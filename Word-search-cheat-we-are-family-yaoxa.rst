The standard Words With Friends® game board is the same size as the Scrabble® board. The standard grid is 15 squares by 15 squares, adding up to squares in total. Some additional game modes, like the Solo Challenge, use a smaller 11 x 11 game board ( squares) for a tighter, faster-paced game.  · Scrabble Word Finder is a helpful tool for Scrabble® players - both on a traditional board and Scrabble Go fans. By entering your letter tiles in the search box, Scrabble Word Finder finds the best cheats and high scoring words instantly. The advanced options are intuitive, and easy to use, for seasoned pros and newcomers alike.  · The WordFinder™ word search unscrambles your letters, searches our Words With Friends®, Wordscapes®, Word Chums® or Scrabble® dictionary for words that win, and gives them to you sorted by word length and point value. Our word finder tool couldn’t be any easier to use! For a more detailed explanation of how to use our word finder tool.
