About Word Wars Cheat. Word Wars is a turn-based multiplayer word game that pits you against your friends. The game gives you 7 letters and a 15x15 board so that you can create long, extravagant words to rake in the most points. If you're feeling like testing waters, there's also a robot you can play against instead. Check Out  for better and updated scripts. @ Exploit I Used:  I used:  Missing: cheat robots. WordFinder™ isn’t just a word search. It’s a total WWF cheat solution. All you need to do is type in your letter tiles and hit the search button. The Words With Friends® cheat tool provides a full list of playable, legal words from those letters, straight from the Words With Friends® game. Every set of search results comes sorted by.
