I got the achievement for killing 20 enemies with the chainsaw, despite having used keys that I bound to god, noclip, notarget and give all.  · Doom 2 Easter Egg. There's an Easter egg hidden near the very end of the game that's very easy to miss. In the last level, use the IDCLIP cheat and walk through the final boss to enter a hallway where you'll find the disembodied head of the game's director, John Romero. Shoot his head to beat the game.
