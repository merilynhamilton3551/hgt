 · The Walking Dead: Road to Survival is a new turn-based RPG from Scopely. The game gives players a team of survivors and the chance to carve out a small town amidst a rampaging zombie apocalypse. Press and hold a character’s icon at the bottom of the screen during battle to view their skills and set them to defend, by swiping right. When switching up characters on your teams, don’t forget to reassign weapons best suited for the battle. Always kill the zombies closest to you first! Avoid letting them get close enough to do damage to. Those following the Walking Dead: Road to Survival Tips now expects cheats will be disappointed. The game is free, but is funded through in-app purchases. Who wants to speed up the gameplay has to do this with hard currency. Accordingly, the developers have put a focus on it, yet useful items are neither unlimited coins for free.
