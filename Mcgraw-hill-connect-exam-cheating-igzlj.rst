On the exams it all depends on what the professor sets. I took Financial Accounting and Managerial Accounting online and they used McGraw Connect, and the exams and tests were set to allow you to use "check my work" only one time on each question, even multi part ones that had 7 or 8 tabs if work. Does McGraw Hill Connect record you? Our system allows the student to be recorded while taking the exam in the same manner as an instructor recording a lecture. Additionally, we have implemented a number of different options making this a secure test-taking feature, such as a visual identification method and the disabling of the pause controls. Can online tests detect . Yes, the McGraw hill connect platform can catch someone from cheating. The tool has a remote web proctoring system that helps the evaluators review the student’s activity during the exam. Some people still don’t give up and think of other ways to cheat to get the McGraw homework answers.
