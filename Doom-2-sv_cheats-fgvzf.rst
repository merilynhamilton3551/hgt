 · This page contains a list of cheats, codes, Easter eggs, tips, and other secrets for Doom II for  you've discovered a cheat you'd like to .  · Once again, this level is not in the German version of Doom II To get to the second secret level from the first, go to the last room (with the 12 SS guards and the elevator) and immediately turn to your right, and open the wall back to a secret area with health%(5).  · Registered: Posted Novem. So I was wondering if I could change the message that appears when you try to cheat when sv_cheats is 0.
